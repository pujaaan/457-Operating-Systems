There are some bugs with the program. The size does not seem to be working correctly. The symbolic link hasnt been implemented. The md5Sum seems to work without any trouble. I was really sick this week so I wasn't able to implement a lot of the assignment but I understand the concept and have become a little familiar with C programming. The assumptions i made was the list has to be sorted in alphabetical order. First of all it makes the list easier to see and also in the sample output it was ascending in an alphabetical order. 
In order to compile it you would go to the directory the file is saved onto and just type make onto the terminal. And after it compiles you just use ./gls and then the driectory name.
