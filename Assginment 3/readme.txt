Customers arrive at the shop and enter a queue to place an order for drinks. 
Drink orders can be quick, medium or slow and customers may order one or 
more drinks at a time. Once the customer has given their order to the barista, 
they must wait for their order to be completed. When an order is received it 
must be recorded in the cash register and then it must be produced. When producing
 a drink order the barista must wait for a set period of time 
 (to simulate actual work happening). Once an order has been completed 
 it can be given to the customer.

Arguments:
	customer : int greater than or equal to 1
	barista	: int greater than or equal to 1
	model: 0 for train and 1 for space
How to run:
	1) navigate into the assignment directory from the terminal
	2) use the make all command
	3) ./a3 <customer><barista><model>
	
	or
	
	1) gcc -lpthread a3.c -o a3
	2) ./a3 <customer><barista><model>

Assumptions: The only assumption I made is that when you want to run space 
	model, you provide more than one baristas.


Problems-
Evaluation 3 isnt completed. The code modifications didnot seem to work.
Gitlab isnt working.
